    "# Analyzing Text from School Websites\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this ongoing project, I explore how different UK schools choose to present themselves on their websites. Do schools with poor academic performance emphasize other attributes, and if so which? Do different types of schools - such as academies, community schools, and private schools - choose to highlight different characteristics? How do the characteristics that schools choose to emphasize correspond to measures that we have of underlying realities? \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to help parents choosing between schools to evaluate and make use of the marketing with which the are prsented. I will investigate the extent to which parents should trust what schools say; for example, do the attributes that schools choose to emphasize correlate with the administrative measures or the perceptions of parents with children at a school? I will also explore whether there are any useful heuristics that parents can employ in examining school reviews; for example, if a school fails to mention academic performance, is this a bad sign?\n",
    "\n",
    "I begin by discussing how I constructed the dataset of text from school webisites used in this analysis. After loading the packages and text data used in this analysis, I then employ two different approachs to analyzing the text from school websites: clustering with k-means and mixed membership modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). I then link the output from these analyses of my text data to datasets on school performance and other features, and explore the relationship between the text from school websites and other school characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is very much a work in progress, and throughout I will point to text steps that I plan to take in my analysis.\n",

    "# Construct dataset from school websites\n",
    "\n",
    "I investigate how schools present themselves on their websites by analyzing text from the homepages of school websites. Specifically, I focus on the introductory \"blurb\" found on many school websites, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"blurb_example.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by downloading a list of 26,641 urls for the websites of schools in England from the Department of Education's [Edubase public portal](http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/home.xhtml). I then scraped the text from all of the working URLs using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difficulty in building my scraper was that schools have text about all kinds of things on their homepage, and comparing, for example, the introductory blurb from one website to a pile of news from another is unlikely to yield much interesting. Further complicating matters, the construction of websites is inconsistent across schools, making it difficult to easily capture the introductory blurb.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by taking the largest block of text that I could find on each page, but this missed a lot of blurbs I wanted to catch, only caught part of some blurbs, and picked up a lot of other mess. However, I noticed that many blurbs either started with \"Welcome\", or ended with the headteacher signing off.\n",
    "\n",
    "I therefore wrote a spider that, in short, would collect paragraphs of text below \"Welcome\" or above \"Headteacher\", \"Head of School\", or various other words used for principal. I limited the blurbs I scraped to strings of 200 words or greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scraper produced a databse of X text reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory analysis of sample\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth first understanding a bit about this sample. Of X institutions listed in the EduBase datset, X have urls in the dataset, and of these I have obtained blurbs for X schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I take a look at the proportion of observations for which I have urls, was woring urls, was able to scrape some text etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "***To load the dataset, I had to delete the observation for http://www.stmh.co.uk/. It had filled up with no blurb, and instead listing a bunch of column headings. I'm not sure why - when I tried running the scraper for just that observation it worked fine.***\n",
    "\n",
    "***I should merge datasets early, and drop obs for which the establishment is closed***"

    "<li> ngram_range: the lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different n-grams to be extracted. An n-gram is basically a set of co-occuring words, and you typically move one for more word forward. For example, if n=2 (known as bigrams) then for the sentence \"The cow jumps over the moon\" the bigrams would be \"the cose\" \"cow jumps\" \"jumps over\" \"over the\" \"the moon\".

I will refer to this measure as cluster heterogenity (the sum of the heterogeneities over all clusters). The larger the distances, the more hetergoenous the clusters are, and the smaller the distances the more homogenous. We would like homogenous/tight clusters. A word of caution with this terminology: the scikit-learn [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.homogeneity_score.html#sklearn.metrics.homogeneity_score) also uses homogeneity to refer to a particular metric of cluster labeling given the truth.\n",

For example, if we have N data points and set k=N clusters, then we could have 0 cluster heterogeneity by setting the N centroids equal to the values of the N data points. One heuristic you can use to choose k is to plot heterogeneity against k and look for the \"elbow\" of the curve. This naturally trades off between trying to minimize heterogeneity, but reduce model complexity.\n",

    "# Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We have so far used the k-means alogrithm to assign the text blurb from each school website to a single cluster (a mixture model). But we may instead want to think of each blurb as falling into multiple clusters; for example, a blurb may talk about both academic performance and a religious culture. Mixed memership models allow use to associate a given data point with a set of different cluster assignments and to capture the relative proportion of different clusters in a datapoint. Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) one such mixed membership model.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief overview of LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I briefly discuss the LDA model and inference using this model. For further refernece, David Blei has an [excellent couple of talks](http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_blei_tm/) introducing topic modelling, and LDA in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probabalistic generative model\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA assumes that there are some number k of topics that live outside of the document collection. Each topic is a distribution over the entire fixed vocabulary of v words (that is, a vector that assigns a probability to every word in teh vocabulary). The topics (the distributions over words) follow a v-dimensinoal Dirichlet distribution : $\\beta_k ~ Dir(\\eta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Aside:* If you haven't seen it before, don't be confused by the fact that the Dirichlet is a distribution of distributions. Each draw from the Dirichlet assigns a probability to each element of a vector (whose length is determined by the dimensinoality of the Dirichlet), and these vectors of probabilities (which in our case we call topics) follow a Dichlet distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "LDA posits the following data generation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each document, d\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Draw a distribution over all k topics from the Dirichlet distribution: $\\theta_d ~ Dir(\\alpha)$. (Again, each individual draw is a vector of probabilities over all k topics, and these vectors follow a Dirichlet distribution). \n",
    "<li>For each word, n, in the document:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Draw a topic assignment from a multinomial distribution with the parameters you drew in (1): $Z_{d,n} ~ Multi(\\theta_d)$. Use this to select the corresponding topic, \\beta_{z_{dn}}, from the top matrix.\n",
    "<li>Draw a word from the topic that you selected in (2i): \n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computation (inferring hidden variables from the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "The only variable form the above model that we actually get to observe is the words W_{d,n}. We need to infer the latent (hidden) variables in the model from the data; specifically, we need to infer:\n",
    "<li>per-word topic assignments: $z_{d,n}$</li>\n",
    "<li>per-document topic proportions: $\\theta_d$</li>\n",
    "<li>per-corpus topic distributions: $\\beta_k$</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a hierarchical Bayesian model: a statistical model written in multiple levels that estimates the parameters of the posterior distribution using the Bayesian method. In this case, the posterior is the distribution of the hidden variables given the observations (words). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this posterior is intractable to compute. Therefore, we appeal to approximate posterior inference of the posterior (that is, we need a method that will infer an approximation of the posterior distribution). There are a variety of methods for doing this:\n",
    "<li>Gibbs sampling</li>\n",
    "<li>variational methods</li>\n",
    "<li>per-corpus topic distributions: $\\beta_k$</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up our model and algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "There a number of things that we may want to explore varying in setting up our model (this list is not exhaustive, for example, we might also explore which n-grams to include in our bag of words):\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>number of topics, k\n",
    "<li>model hyperparameters (paramaters of the prior distributions)\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>$\\alpha$ - influences document-topic density: with a higher alpha documents are like to be made up of a mixture of most of the topics, and not any single topic specifically. A low alpha value puts less such constraints on documents and means that it is more likely that a document may contain mixture of just a few, or even only one, of the topics. To visualize this, assume a symetric distribution (only one value for alpha) and that there are three topics (so alpha is of length three, and each draw from the Dirichlet is a vecotr of length three). If alpha is greater than 1 there will be a peak to the distribution over vectors centered at $E[\\theta_i|\\alpha]$. The higher the value of alpha, the more peaky this distribution, that is, the more probability each draw assigns to vectors near the mean, and the less to other vectors (notably, vectors in the conresr that put a lot of weight on just one topic. \n",
    "<li>$\\eta$ - similarly influence topic-word density: a high beta-value means that each topic is likely to contain a mixture of most of the words, and not any word specifically, while a low value means that a topic may contain a mixture of just a few of the words..\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we could experiment with different algorithms in training our LDA model.\n",
    "\n",

I can then conduct grid searches for the best values of k, alpha, and eta. In order to do this, I will likely need to use the [parallel processing tools build into gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/dist_lda.html), together with a service such as AWS.

But Gibbs sampling has advantages over this method. I should therefore like to instead try repeating my analsis with Gibbs sampling. I could perhaps again use perplexity to compare outcomes from my analysis with Gibbs sampling to my analysis with variation inference. There is a wrapper in Python that should allow me to use Gibbs sampling with Gensim; however, it might instead be easier to use the LDA method in graphlab. "
