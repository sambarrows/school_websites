    "On the face of it, we might suspect that if a school's website talks a lot about culture or other attributes but fails to mention academic performance, this should raise the suspicions. Poorly performing schools may well bury bad news and try and highlight the areas where they perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not necessarily the case. The theory of \"information unravelling\" proposes that because consumers can infer that organizations that do not disclose information are likely to have worse quality than firms that do, everyone has an incentive to disclose. The theory of \"countersignalling goes even further: not disclosing information may signal that schools are so confident their academic performance is impressive that they don't even need to mention it (see [Luca & Smith 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268114003369)).\n",

    "## Scraping school websites\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by downloading a list of 26,641 urls for the websites of schools in England from the Department of Education's [Edubase public portal](http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/home.xhtml). I then scraped the text from all of the working URLs using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) on an EC2 m4.xlarge instance. You can find this code in the *schools_spider* directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difficulty in building my scraper was that schools have text about all kinds of things on their homepage, and comparing the introductory blurb from one website with a news story from another is unlikely to yield much of interest. Further complicating matters, the construction of websites is inconsistent across schools, making it difficult to easily capture the introductory blurb.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by taking the largest block of text that I could find on each page, but this missed a lot of the blurbs I wanted to catch, only caught part of some blurbs, and picked up a lot of other mess. However, I noticed that many blurbs either started with \"Welcome\", or ended with the headteacher signing off. I therefore wrote a spider that collects paragraphs of text below \"Welcome\" or above \"Headteacher\", \"Head of School\", or various other words used for principal. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I spend more time on this project, I should like to improve my dataset by obtaining the URLs for more schools. I could do this my searching for schools and taking the top results using the Bing API. I should also like to try to improve my scraper to capture the blurbs from a higher proportion of school websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tidying data\n",

    "I begin by examining the numbers of observations for which I was successfully able to scrape a blurb and the length of these blurbs. "

    "\n",
    "<b>Probabalistic generative model</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA assumes that there are some number k of topics that live outside of the document collection. Each topic is a distribution over the entire fixed vocabulary of v words (that is, a vector that assigns a probability to every word in the vocabulary). The topics (the distributions over words) follow a v-dimensional Dirichlet distribution : \\\\( \\beta_k \\sim Dir(\\eta) \\\\). LDA posits the following data generation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each document, d\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Draw a distribution over all k topics from the Dirichlet distribution: \\\\( \\theta_d \\sim Dir(\\alpha) \\\\).</li> \n",
    "<li>For each word, n, in the document:</li>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Draw a topic assignment from a multinomial distribution with the parameters you drew in (1): \\\\( Z_{d,n} \\sim Multi(\\theta_d) \\\\). Use this to select the corresponding topic, \\\\( \\beta_{z_{dn}} \\\\), from the top matrix.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "The only variable form the above model that we actually get to observe is the words \\\\( W_{d,n} \\\\). We need to infer the latent (hidden) variables in the model from the data; specifically, we need to infer per-word topic assignments (\\\\( z_{d,n} \\\\)), per-document topic proportions (\\\\( \\theta_d \\\\)), and per-corpus topic distributions (\\\\( \\beta_k \\\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a hierarchical Bayesian model: a statistical model written in multiple levels that estimates the parameters of the posterior distribution using the Bayesian method. In this case, the posterior is the distribution of the hidden variables given the observations (words). Unfortunately, this posterior is intractable to compute. Therefore, we appeal to approximate posterior inference of the posterior (that is, we need a method that will infer an approximation of the posterior distribution). There are a variety of methods for doing this, but here we will use [online variational Bayes](https://rare-technologies.com/tutorial-on-mallet-in-python/).\n",

    "There are at least two ways in which I should like to improve my LDA analysis. First, I should like to address the issue of calculating perplexity, and find optimal values for k, alpha, and eta. Probably the best approach would be to find a different measure for evaluating the models. Perplexity would not be ideal even if it worked, as it is a measure of predictive performance, but I am not using LDA for the purposes of prediction.\n",

    "Second, I should like to explore different algorithms for approximating the posterior/fitting my model. So far in training my LDA model I have only used [\"online variational Bayes\"](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/HoffmanBleiBach2010b.pdf), the [method built into gensim](https://rare-technologies.com/multicore-lda-in-python-from-over-night-to-over-lunch/). I should like to instead try repeating my analysis with other methods, such as Gibbs sampling.  There is a wrapper in Python that should allow me to use Gibbs sampling with Gensim; however, it might instead be easier to use the LDA method in graphlab.\n",

    "I examine whether there is a relationship between an elementary school’s performance in Key Stage 2 math exams (exams that students sit at the end of primary school) and topic proportions in the schools clubs. We might expect, for example, that schools with greater academic success would see a higher topic proportion for the corresponding topic. However, we see no evidence that this is the case.\n",

    "## Ofsted inspections\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to school test score being publicly reported, schools in England are subject to inspections by Ofsted. I explore whether there is a relationship between the grade a school was last assigned by Ofsted, and the topics discussed on their website.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ofsted_topics.png\", width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that schools getting the lowest grade mention inspectsion more. However, I do not read much into this result as closer examination reveals that very few schools fit into this category.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that the topics discussed on school websites do not vary with the underlying performance of schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous possible explanations for these findings. It could be, of course, that the findings are erroneous. Possibly a different approach to clustering websites would yield different results. Likewise, perhaps the results would change if I were able to increase my sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings, if we accept them, are also consistent with information unravelling. Even schools perform poorly academically still mention academics, for example, because it will look bad if they don't. \n",
    "\n",
    "But particular contextual factors, rather than information unravelling, may also explain these findings. For example, test score results and Ofsted inspection grades are so widely available that schools may have little incentive to bury them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway for now, however, is that parents can broadly take school websites at face value. If a school fails to mention its test results, parents should not take this as an indication that its test results are likely to be bad. School websites may well, therefore, be a useful tool for parents searching for schools."
