The lemmatizer uses the pos tags to understand what words might be synonyms.  The lemmatizer would take a word such as *teacher* and *teachers* and make sure both were just *teacher*.

    "\n",
    "### Probabalistic generative model\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA assumes that there are some number k of topics that live outside of the document collection. Each topic is a distribution over the entire fixed vocabulary of v words (that is, a vector that assigns a probability to every word in teh vocabulary). The topics (the distributions over words) follow a v-dimensional Dirichlet distribution : $\\beta_k \\sim Dir(\\eta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't seen it before, don't be confused by the fact that the Dirichlet is a distribution of distributions. Each draw from the Dirichlet assigns a probability to each element of a vector (whose length is determined by the dimensinoality of the Dirichlet), and these vectors of probabilities (which in our case we call topics) follow a Dichlet distribution. \n",

    "\n",
    "For each document, d\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Draw a distribution over all k topics from the Dirichlet distribution: $\\theta_d \\sim Dir(\\alpha)$. (Again, each individual draw is a vector of probabilities over all k topics, and these vectors follow a Dirichlet distribution). \n",

    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Draw a topic assignment from a multinomial distribution with the parameters you drew in (1): $Z_{d,n} \\sim Multi(\\theta_d).$ Use this to select the corresponding topic, $\\beta_{z_{d,n}}$, from the topic matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Computation (inferring hidden variables from the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "The only variable form the above model that we actually get to observe is the words W_{d,n}. We need to infer the latent (hidden) variables in the model from the data; specifically, we need to infer:\n",

A low alpha value puts less such constraints on documents and means that it is more likely that a document may contain mixture of just a few, or even only one, of the topics. To visualize this, assume a symetric distribution (only one value for alpha) and that there are three topics (so alpha is of length three, and each draw from the Dirichlet is a vecotr of length three). If alpha is greater than 1 there will be a peak to the distribution over vectors centered at $E[\\theta_i|\\alpha]$. The higher the value of alpha, the more peaky this distribution, that is, the more probability each draw assigns to vectors near the mean, and the less to other vectors (notably, vectors in the conresr that put a lot of weight on just one topic. \n",
    "<li>$\\eta$ - similarly influence topic-word density: a high beta-value means that each topic is likely to contain a mixture of most of the words, and not any word specifically, while a low value means that a topic may contain a mixture of just a few of the words..\n",

Probably the best approach would be to find a different measure for evaluating the models. Perplexity would not be ideal even if it worked, as it is a measure of predictive performance, but I am not using LDA for the purposes of prediction.\n",

So far in training my LDA model I have only used [\"online variational Bayes\"](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/HoffmanBleiBach2010b.pdf), the [method built into gensim](https://rare-technologies.com/multicore-lda-in-python-from-over-night-to-over-lunch/). I should like to instead try repeating my analsis with other methods, such as Gibbs sampling.  There is a wrapper in Python that should allow me to use Gibbs sampling with Gensim; however, it might instead be easier to use the LDA method in graphlab. "
